# Final Year Project - Trainsplitter

This was my Final Year Project at Uni, developed in Python and Django.

## Abstract 
Travelling is expensive and when buying tickets directly from station to station this is 
not always the cheapest option. Splitting tickets is the only way of guaranteeing the 
cheapest possible option. There are currently a vast number of websites and 
applications that help you split a ticket however the output they provide is always the 
same.

The purpose of this project is to produce a solution that will provide a better visual 
output. Using Python, I will produce a dynamic website, so it can be used by all 
platforms with a web browser, that will split a ticket and provide a map to display the 
results
